# OOP and Java Concepts Used:

•	Inheritance:
We used inheritance to inherit the AWT classes to use it components
For the project. Other than that, we inheritance to gather all frames in
One class for easy navigation application wide.
•	Interface: 
                        We had to implement interfaces defined in AWT classes to customize 
                        Our needs. We implemented those methods as per our usage and 
                        Requirements like Action Listeners, Adapters and etc.
•	Polymorphism:
We made some our method polymorphic as there's different use cases for them.
•	Abstraction:
There are multiple layers of abstraction in these project by design. We adopt AWT 		       classes, there’s also stock java packages and tools also used, and we designed the
Class inheritance hierarchy to make things easy as possible.
•	Typecasting:
There’s many typecasting used project wise. Sometimes we had to get our job done 		      by casting data types to another.

# Impact of this Project:

By using this system, the patients will be able to save their time, money and moreover they do not need to travel along with their bad condition. There is no chance of data loss. Users can access this system from anywhere and anytime. The relationship between admin and patient will be stronger.

# Limitations and Possible Future Improvements:
There is some limitations for this project. 
Patients can not use this system though online for appointment and contact. There is no scope to access this system by multiple admins. Here is no option for patients image and sending data though online.
 
There are many scope to improve this project in future.
In the future, they will be able to use this system though online. Patients will be able to download the data from the system as a file. In future, online help center for  patients will be available and patients will be fixed the appointments with doctors.
